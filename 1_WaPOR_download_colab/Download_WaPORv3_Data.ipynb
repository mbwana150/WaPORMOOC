        "# Download WaPOR version 3 Data.\n",
        "In this notebook we will use the [wapordl package](https://bitbucket.org/cioapps/wapordl/src/main/) to download WaPOR v3 data and download files to your local computer. This short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymBM_EVPEMQ) explains how to use this script. For details of how to use the downloaded WaPOR v3 data, refer to the [MOOC on Introduction to WaPORv3](https://ocw.un-ihe.org/course/view.php?id=263).\n",
        "\n",
        "   \n",
        "The steps are:\n",
        "0. Install and load necessary packages\n",
        "1. Upload a geojson file to define the boundary of area of interest\n",
        "2. Use the wapordl package to download raster files for each variable\n",
        "3. Zip the rasters files and download them to local folder\n",

        "This script can be used without mounting the colab, if you want to use files stored in your google drive or save the files there, you have to mount the script first.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE**: This script allows for downloading WaPOR data in separate tiffs using the WaPOR naming convention, removal of the scaling factor and creating data in the units per the temporal scale of the data (eg dekadal data is converted from mm/day to mm/dekade). For more information about WaPOR data formats check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm5IAy4MHg4). Removal of the scaling factor increases the file size, for more advanced users, check out the [wapordl package](https://bitbucket.org/cioapps/wapordl/src/main/) for more ways to download WaPORv3 data (including an option for downloading 1 file with scaled values in multiple bands for saving space, do note to make sure the scaling factor is applied when utilising such data).\n"
