Or maybe a long list of information that does change over time? Say, for example, the crop types in an agricultural area. You might have new crops, or not grow certain crops. What about a crop yields? For that you need to do a bit of referencing - you would have a list of crops, and attached to each of those crops, the crop yield. How would you do that?"

    "For these three problems, Python uses three different solutions - Tuples, Lists, and Dictionaries:\n",
    "* **Lists** are what they seem - a list of values. Each one of them is numbered, starting from zero - the first one is numbered zero, the second 1, the third 2, etc. You can remove values from the list, and add new values to the end. Example: Your crop types.\n",
    "* **Tuples** are just like lists, but you can't change their values. The values that you give it first up, are the values that you are stuck with for the rest of the program. Again, each value is numbered starting from zero, for easy reference. Example: the names of the months of the year.\n",
    "* **Dictionaries** are similar to what their name suggests - a dictionary. In a dictionary, you have an 'index' of words, and for each of them a definition. In Python, the word is called a 'key', and the definition a 'value'. The values in a dictionary aren't numbered - they aren't in any specific order, either - the key does the same thing. You can add, remove, and modify the values in dictionaries. Example: crop yields."

For this we need *Dictionaries*.\n",
