# WaPORMOOC

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that are part of two MOOCs on the [WaPOR database](https://data.apps.fao.org/wapor/?lang=en). Both MOOCs are free to attend and are open to all who are interested. A reliable internet connection is required. These courses are self-paced with the possibility of obtaining a certificate of completion after completing all assignments.

1. Downloading WaPOR data (part of MOOC ['Introduction to WaPORv3'](https://ocw.un-ihe.org/course/view.php?id=263)) (also available in [Spanish](https://ocw.un-ihe.org/course/view.php?id=269))
2. Introduction to Python (module 2 of MOOC ['Python for geospatial analyses using WaPOR data'](https://ocw.un-ihe.org/course/view.php?id=272))
3. Using Python Libraries for Handling Spatial Data (module 3 of MOOC ['Python for geospatial analyses using WaPOR data'](https://ocw.un-ihe.org/course/view.php?id=272))

For the first script we are utilising the [WaPORDL](https://bitbucket.org/cioapps/wapordl/src/main/) package made available by FAO.
